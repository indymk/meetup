              <p class="h5">My name is Eric Kong and I am one of the organizers for the 2020 meet up. I’m super excited to meet you all and chit chat about keyboards at the event. Here is a little bit about me:</p>
              <p><em>Occupation:</em> Agricultural engineering graduate student</p>
              <p><em>Favorite keyboard:</em> A white MagicForce 49 key with Gateron Reds. This was my first board and it has been my daily driver since. It isn’t valuable, rare, or high quality. But I like the layout and it has been a great tool.</p>
              <p><em>How I got into the hobby:</em> I met some online friends in 2016 while I was playing Overwatch. I was a complete PC gaming noob back then and they always talked about PC peripherals. They introduced me to mechanical keyboards and Massdrop. After that, my interest skyrocketed when I started looking at r/mk, getting involved with the Massdrop community, and talking to my friends about keyboards.</p>
              <p><em>My favorite aspect of the hobby:</em> I like that mechanical keyboards are an extension of my passion for engineering (designing and building). I get lots of satisfaction out of seeing something that I built or modified work.</p>
              <p><em>Fun fact:</em> The ‘R’ keycap on my board is missing because it fell down the garbage disposal when I was cleaning my keycaps. Then the disposal got turned on and it was destroyed. May that keycap rest in pieces.</p>

              <img style="max-height: 400px;" class="img-fluid" loading="lazy" src="images/alex.jpg" alt="Alex Lewis with JR Hildebrand">
              <p class="h5">My name is Alex Lewis and I can't wait to talk keyboards and clacking experiences with everyone at the event. Here is a little bit about me:</p>
              <p><em>Occupation:</em> Software engineer</p>
              <p><em>Favorite keyboard:</em> That's tough. I have a few that I rotate into use at least once a week, but my most favorite is probably a polycarbonate Salamander keyboard with Gateron Fei Matcha switches.</p>
              <p><em>How I got into the hobby:</em> Circa 2015, I had recently started at my first "engineering" job. I'd used an apple wireless keyboard for a few years but it just didn't feel substantial. There were some coworkers that had mechanical keyboards, mostly with Cherry blues or reds in them, but someone had Cherry clears and I was immediately interested in them. Later that night, I order a Vortex Pok3r and the rest involves falling deep into the rabbit hole.</p>
              <p><em>My favorite aspect of the hobby:</em> I began building keyboards (OLKB Planck) because I wasn't getting any sense of "completion" with the things that I was building at work. Building and customizing keyboards give me a sense of completion and I love tweaking a keyboard setup until I'm perfectly happy with it.</p>
              <p><em>Fun fact:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU">Hackerman</a> is my favorite.</p>
